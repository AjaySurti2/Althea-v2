# Storage Bucket Fix - Upload Failed Error Resolved

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: "Upload failed: Bucket not found"
**Console Errors**: 400 status when accessing medical-files bucket

The storage buckets `medical-files` and `report-pdfs` were missing from your Supabase project, causing all file uploads to fail.

---

## Root Cause
The application code referenced storage buckets that didn't exist in the database:
- `medical-files` - For user-uploaded medical documents
- `report-pdfs` - For generated AI summaries

When users tried to upload files, Supabase returned a 400 error because the buckets didn't exist.

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Storage Buckets
**Migration**: `20251017_create_storage_buckets`

**medical-files bucket:**
- Size limit: 50MB per file
- Privacy: Private (users can only access their own files)
- Allowed types: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX, TXT, WEBP

**report-pdfs bucket:**
- Size limit: 10MB per file
- Privacy: Private (users can only access their own files)
- Allowed types: PDF, HTML

### 2. Configured Row Level Security (RLS)
Created 8 security policies (4 per bucket):

**For each bucket:**
1. ✅ INSERT policy - Users can upload to their own folder
2. ✅ SELECT policy - Users can read their own files
3. ✅ UPDATE policy - Users can update their own files
4. ✅ DELETE policy - Users can delete their own files

**Security Model:**
- File paths must start with the user's ID: `{user_id}/{session_id}/{filename}`
- Users cannot access other users' files
- All operations require authentication

---

## What's Fixed

✅ **File Upload** - Users can now upload medical documents
✅ **File Storage** - Files are securely stored in Supabase Storage
✅ **File Access** - Users can view/download their uploaded files
✅ **Security** - RLS ensures users only access their own data
✅ **Error Messages** - No more "Bucket not found" errors

## Bucket Configuration Details

### medical-files Bucket
```json
{
  "id": "medical-files",
  "name": "medical-files",
  "public": false,
  "file_size_limit": 52428800,
  "allowed_mime_types": [
    "application/pdf",
    "image/jpeg",
    "image/jpg",
    "image/png",
    "image/webp",
    "text/plain",
    "application/msword",
    "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
  ]
}
```

### report-pdfs Bucket
```json
{
  "id": "report-pdfs",
  "name": "report-pdfs",
  "public": false,
  "file_size_limit": 10485760,
  "allowed_mime_types": [
    "application/pdf",
    "text/html"
  ]
}
```

## File Upload Flow (Now Working)

1. **User selects file** on Upload page
2. **Frontend validates** file type and size
3. **Creates session** in database
4. **Uploads to Supabase Storage** at path: `{user_id}/{session_id}/{filename}`
5. **RLS checks permissions** - User owns the folder
6. **File stored successfully**
7. **Database record created** in `files` table
8. **AI parsing triggered** via Edge Function
9. **Results stored** in `parsed_documents` table
10. **Dashboard updated** with new data

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test File Upload
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to Dashboard → "Upload Documents"
3. Select a PDF medical report
4. Click "Upload"
5. ✅ Should upload successfully (no "Bucket not found" error)
6. ✅ Should show in document list
7. ✅ Should be parseable by AI

### Test File Access
1. Upload a file
2. Go to "Total Reports" or "Document Review"
3. Click to view/download the file
4. ✅ Should load without 400 errors
5. ✅ File should display/download correctly

---

## Security Verification

Run this SQL to verify the setup:

```sql
-- Check buckets exist
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit
FROM storage.buckets;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage'
AND tablename = 'objects'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Test user can only access own files
SELECT * FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'medical-files'
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text;
```

---

## File Path Structure

All files are stored with this path pattern:
```
bucket-name/{user-id}/{session-id}/{filename}

Example:
medical-files/30824fe8-4ab0-41af-9cfb-0c6a49572388/a78bdbb6-77f1-4fb1-86c0-2be1e89f9f6d/Report-Mrs.CHAMPABEN.pdf
```

This ensures:
- User isolation (each user has their own folder)
- Session tracking (files grouped by upload session)
- RLS enforcement (path checked against auth.uid())

---

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh Application** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Clear Browser Cache** - Clear cache and localStorage
3. **Test Upload** - Try uploading a medical document
4. **Verify Dashboard** - Check that uploaded files appear

The storage system is now fully functional and ready for file uploads!
