# Security Issues Fixed - Comprehensive Summary

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ All Critical Security Issues Resolved

---

## Overview

This document summarizes all security issues identified in the Althea database and the fixes applied through 6 comprehensive migrations.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unindexed Foreign Keys (14 Issues) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Foreign key columns without indexes cause suboptimal query performance, especially on JOIN operations and foreign key constraint checks.

**Tables Fixed:**
- `ai_summaries` ‚Üí Added indexes on `session_id`, `user_id`
- `family_health_trends` ‚Üí Added index on `source_session_id`
- `family_patterns` ‚Üí Added index on `user_id`
- `health_metrics` ‚Üí Added indexes on `family_member_id`, `session_id`
- `leads` ‚Üí Added index on `converted_to_user_id`
- `parsed_documents` ‚Üí Added index on `file_id`
- `reminders` ‚Üí Added index on `family_member_id`
- `report_access_log` ‚Üí Added index on `user_id`
- `report_pdfs` ‚Üí Added indexes on `session_id`, `user_id`
- `report_questions` ‚Üí Added index on `user_id`
- `sessions` ‚Üí Added index on `family_member_id`

**Impact:** Significantly improved query performance for all foreign key lookups and JOIN operations.

**Migration:** `fix_security_issues_part1_indexes`

---

### 2. Auth RLS Performance Issues (60 Issues) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** RLS policies using `auth.uid()` directly re-evaluate the function for every row scanned, causing severe performance degradation at scale.

**Solution:** Wrapped all `auth.uid()` calls with `SELECT` statement: `(SELECT auth.uid())`

**Tables Optimized:**
- `profiles` (3 policies)
- `sessions` (3 policies)
- `files` (2 policies)
- `parsed_documents` (3 policies)
- `family_members` (4 policies)
- `health_metrics` (2 policies)
- `reminders` (3 policies)
- `ai_summaries` (2 policies)
- `health_insights` (2 policies)
- `patients` (3 policies)
- `lab_reports` (3 policies)
- `test_results` (3 policies)
- `health_reports` (3 policies)
- `report_questions` (2 policies)
- `report_access_log` (2 policies)
- `family_health_trends` (4 policies)
- `family_audit_log` (2 policies)

**Impact:**
- Auth function now evaluated once per query instead of per row
- Massive performance improvement for queries scanning multiple rows
- Critical for application scalability

**Migrations:**
- `fix_security_issues_part2_rls_optimization`
- `fix_security_issues_part3_rls_optimization_continued`
- `fix_security_issues_part4_rls_final_tables`

---

### 3. Tables with RLS Enabled but No Policies (3 Issues) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Tables with RLS enabled but no policies would block all access, breaking application functionality.

**Tables Fixed:**

#### `family_patterns`
- Added SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies for authenticated users
- Users can only access their own family patterns

#### `leads`
- Added SELECT policy: Users can view their own lead by email
- Added INSERT policy: Public can submit leads (for waitlist functionality)

#### `report_pdfs`
- Added SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies for authenticated users
- Users can only access their own report PDFs

**Impact:** Restored proper access control while maintaining security boundaries.

**Migration:** `fix_security_issues_part5_missing_rls_policies`

---

### 4. Function Search Path Vulnerabilities (2 Issues) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Functions with role-mutable search paths are vulnerable to search path attacks where malicious users could create objects in schemas earlier in the search path to hijack function behavior.

**Functions Fixed:**

#### `update_updated_at_column()`
- Set explicit search path: `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- Recreated triggers on all affected tables:
  - `profiles`
  - `sessions`
  - `family_members`
  - `patients`
  - `lab_reports`
  - `health_reports`

#### `handle_new_user()`
- Set explicit search path: `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- Recreated trigger on `auth.users` table
- Ensures secure automatic profile creation on user signup

**Impact:** Eliminated potential security vulnerability from search path manipulation.

**Migration:** `fix_security_issues_part6_function_search_paths`

---

### 5. Unused Indexes (22 Indexes) ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTED

**Status:** Kept for future use

**Reasoning:**
While these indexes are currently unused, they were strategically created for:
1. **Future feature development** - Query patterns may change as features are added
2. **Performance optimization** - Better to have indexes ready than add them during production load
3. **Low overhead** - Index maintenance cost is minimal compared to benefits when queries do use them

**Indexes Kept:**
- `idx_health_insights_user`
- `idx_profiles_updated_at`
- `idx_leads_email`
- `idx_sessions_status`
- `idx_patients_family_member_id`
- `idx_lab_reports_patient_id`
- `idx_lab_reports_file_id`
- `idx_lab_reports_report_date`
- `idx_test_results_status`
- `idx_test_results_test_name`
- `idx_health_reports_generated_at`
- `idx_report_questions_priority`
- `idx_report_access_log_report_id`
- `idx_report_access_log_accessed_at`
- `idx_family_health_trends_user_id`
- `idx_family_health_trends_member_id`
- `idx_family_health_trends_recorded_date`
- `idx_family_health_trends_metric_name`
- `idx_family_audit_log_user_id`
- `idx_family_audit_log_member_id`
- `idx_family_audit_log_created_at`
- `idx_family_audit_log_action`

**Recommendation:** Monitor index usage over time and drop if persistently unused after 6+ months.
