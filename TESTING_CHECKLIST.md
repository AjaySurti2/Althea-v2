## üîß SQL Test Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify database state:

### Check Bucket Configuration
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  public,
  file_size_limit / 1048576 AS size_limit_mb,
  array_length(allowed_mime_types, 1) AS mime_types_count,
  created_at
FROM storage.buckets
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Expected**: 2 rows (medical-files, report-pdfs)

### Check Storage Policies
```sql
SELECT
  policyname,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

**Expected**: 8 policies (4 for each bucket)

### Check User Files
```sql
-- Replace {user_id} with actual user ID
SELECT
  f.id,
  f.file_name,
  f.file_type,
  f.file_size / 1024 AS size_kb,
  f.storage_path,
  f.created_at
FROM files f
WHERE f.user_id = '{user_id}'
ORDER BY f.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**: User's uploaded files appear

### Test RLS Policy
```sql
-- This should only return the authenticated user's files
SELECT
  bucket_id,
  name,
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] AS user_folder
FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'medical-files'
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected**: Only files in user's folder visible

### Check Profile Updates
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  full_name,
  date_of_birth,
  company_name,
  phone,
  updated_at
FROM profiles
WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

**Expected**: User's profile with date_of_birth field

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### "Bucket not found" Error Returns
**Cause**: Buckets deleted or migration rolled back
**Fix**:
```sql
-- Re-run bucket creation
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets;
-- If empty, re-apply create_storage_buckets migration
```

### "Permission denied" Error
**Cause**: RLS policies blocking access
**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check policies exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'storage';
-- Should return 8
-- If not, re-apply storage policies migration
```

### Files Upload But Don't Appear
**Cause**: Database record not created
**Fix**:
- Check files table has record
- Verify foreign key to sessions table
- Ensure user_id matches authenticated user

### Files Appear For Wrong User
**Cause**: RLS policies not working
**Fix**:
- Verify RLS enabled on storage.objects
- Check policy uses auth.uid() correctly
- Test with different users to confirm isolation

**Auth Issues**: Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication

**Emergency SQL to Check Everything**:
```sql
-- One query to check everything
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM storage.buckets) AS buckets,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'storage') AS storage_policies,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public') AS public_tables,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables t JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.tablename
   WHERE t.schemaname = 'public' AND c.relrowsecurity = true) AS rls_enabled_tables;
```

**Expected Result**: `buckets=2, storage_policies=8, public_tables=16, rls_enabled_tables=17`
