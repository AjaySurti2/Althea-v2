# PDF Upload Disable - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successful

---

## What Was Changed

PDF upload functionality has been temporarily disabled across the application while maintaining full support for image uploads (PNG, JPEG, WEBP).

### Modified Files

1. **`/src/components/UploadWorkflow.tsx`**
   - Added early PDF detection and blocking
   - Removed `application/pdf` from accepted file types
   - Updated UI to show temporary restriction notice
   - Changed error messages to professional, user-friendly text

2. **`/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`**
   - Updated error message for consistency
   - Maintains PDF blocking with clear communication

---

## User Experience Changes

### Before
```
Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WEBP, PDF
‚Ä¢ Images: MAX 10MB each
‚Ä¢ PDFs: MAX 20MB each
```

### After
```
Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WEBP (images only)
‚Ä¢ MAX. 10MB per file
‚ö†Ô∏è PDF uploads temporarily unavailable
```

### Error Message
When user attempts to upload PDF:
```
PDF Upload Temporarily Unavailable

PDF uploads are temporarily disabled while we enhance
our parsing system.

Image uploads (PNG, JPEG, WEBP) remain fully available.

This feature will be restored shortly.
Thank you for your patience.
```

## Technical Details

### Validation Changes

**UploadWorkflow.tsx - File Validation:**
```typescript
// TEMPORARY: Block PDF uploads during system maintenance
const pdfFiles = selectedFiles.filter(file =>
  file.type === 'application/pdf' ||
  file.name.toLowerCase().endsWith('.pdf')
);

if (pdfFiles.length > 0) {
  // Show temporary restriction alert
  return;
}

// Only allow images
const supportedTypes = [
  'image/png',
  'image/jpeg',
  'image/jpg',
  'image/webp'
];
```

**File Input Restriction:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
accept="...application/pdf,.pdf"

<!-- After -->
accept="image/png,image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/webp,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.webp"
```

### UI Changes

Added visual notice in upload area:
```jsx
<div className="mt-3 px-3 py-2 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50
     border border-yellow-200">
  <p className="text-xs text-yellow-700 text-center">
    PDF uploads temporarily unavailable
  </p>
</div>
```

---

## What Still Works

‚úÖ **Full Functionality:**
- Image uploads (PNG, JPEG, WEBP)
- Multiple file uploads
- File size validation (10MB for images)
- Drag and drop
- File preview
- All parsing workflows for images
- Document review and management
- Health insights generation

‚ùå **Temporarily Disabled:**
- PDF file selection
- PDF drag and drop
- PDF processing/parsing

---

## Backend Status

üü¢ **No Backend Changes Required**

- Edge Functions still support PDF processing
- Storage buckets still accept PDF MIME types
- Database schema unchanged
- API endpoints remain functional

**Why this matters:**
- Easy to re-enable when ready
- No migrations needed for reversal
- Can test PDF backend independently
- Quick rollback if issues arise

---

## How to Re-Enable PDF Uploads

### Quick Steps (5 minutes):

1. **Edit `/src/components/UploadWorkflow.tsx`:**
   - Remove PDF blocking code (lines ~84-100)
   - Add back `'application/pdf'` to `supportedTypes` array
   - Restore PDF file input accept attribute
   - Remove temporary restriction UI notice
   - Restore original upload area text

2. **Edit `/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`:**
   - Update or remove PDF error message

3. **Build and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy to production
   ```

4. **Test PDF uploads**

**Full reversal instructions:** See `PDF_UPLOAD_TEMPORARY_DISABLE.md`

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Upload Volume**
   - Track decrease in total uploads
   - Monitor image-only uploads
   - Watch for support tickets

2. **User Behavior**
   - Users converting PDFs to images
   - Upload abandonment rate
   - Time between visits

3. **Support Impact**
   - Questions about PDF restriction
   - Requests for timeline
   - Workaround requests

### SQL Query for Monitoring

```sql
-- Check upload patterns since restriction
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as upload_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_uploads,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN file_type LIKE 'image/%' THEN 1 END) as image_uploads,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN file_type = 'application/pdf' THEN 1 END) as pdf_uploads,
  ROUND(AVG(file_size_bytes / 1024.0 / 1024.0), 2) as avg_size_mb
FROM files
WHERE created_at > '2025-10-30'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY upload_date DESC;
```

## Communication Plan

### User Announcement (Suggested)

**In-App Banner:**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Service Update: PDF uploads are temporarily unavailable
while we enhance our system. Image uploads remain fully
functional. Feature will be restored shortly.
```

**Email to Active Users:**
```
Subject: Temporary Service Update - PDF Uploads

Hi [Name],

We're making improvements to better serve you! During this
brief maintenance period:

‚úÖ Image uploads (PNG, JPEG, WEBP) - Fully available
‚è∏Ô∏è PDF uploads - Temporarily paused

You can continue uploading medical reports by:
‚Ä¢ Converting PDFs to images
‚Ä¢ Taking screenshots of PDF pages
‚Ä¢ Using free online PDF-to-image converters

Expected duration: [timeframe]

Thanks for your patience!
- Althea Team
```

### Support Team Script

**When users ask about PDF uploads:**

"PDF uploads are temporarily disabled while we enhance our
parsing system. You can continue using Althea by uploading
your medical reports as images (PNG, JPEG, or WEBP format).
You can convert PDFs using free online tools or take
screenshots. The feature will return shortly. Is there
anything else I can help you with?"

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can users still see their previously uploaded PDFs?**
A: Yes, all historical data is preserved. Only new uploads are affected.

**Q: What if a user bypasses the frontend restriction?**
A: Backend still supports PDFs. However, normal users can't bypass the UI.

**Q: How long should this restriction last?**
A: As short as possible. Ideally measured in hours/days, not weeks.

**Q: Will this affect existing parsing jobs?**
A: No, only new uploads are blocked. Processing continues normally.

**Q: Can we partially re-enable (e.g., beta users only)?**
A: Yes, but would require additional code to check user flags.

## Conclusion

PDF upload functionality has been successfully disabled with:
- ‚úÖ Clean, reversible code changes
- ‚úÖ Professional user communication
- ‚úÖ Full documentation for reversal
