## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I don't see any tabs"
**Solution**: Scroll down. The tabs are below the 4 stat cards.

### Issue: "I clicked Total Reports but nothing shows"
**Possible causes**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 > Console)
2. The tab might be selected but loading (look for spinner)
3. There might be no sessions yet (you'll see "No sessions yet" message)

### Issue: "Total Reports tab is greyed out"
**Solution**: The tab should never be greyed out. If it is, try refreshing the page.

### Issue: "I see sessions but can't expand them"
**Solution**: Click the **chevron icon** (>) on the left side of each session card.

### Issue: "No documents show up when I expand"
**Solution**: If a session has 0 documents, it will show "No documents in this session". This is normal if files were deleted or failed to upload.
