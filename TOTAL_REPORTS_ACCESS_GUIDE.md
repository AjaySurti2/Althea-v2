```

## 🎉 Summary

The 400 errors were caused by trying to use database columns that don't exist yet. This has been fixed by removing those column references.

### How to Use:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Total Reports" tab (2nd tab)
3. Expand sessions with chevron (>)
4. Download/delete as needed

### No Migration Required:
The app works perfectly without applying the database migration. Apply the migration later if you want soft-delete and other advanced features.
