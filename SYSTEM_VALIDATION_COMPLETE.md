## 🎯 Testing Instructions

### IMPORTANT: File Format Support

**Currently Supported:**
- ✅ PNG (.png)
- ✅ JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- ✅ WEBP (.webp)

**Not Currently Supported:**
- ❌ PDF (.pdf) - OpenAI Vision API limitation

### Why PDFs Don't Work Yet

OpenAI's Vision API cannot process PDF files directly. PDFs need to be converted to images first. This is a known limitation and requires additional processing.

### Workaround for Testing with PDFs

**Option 1: Convert PDF to Images**
1. Open your PDF medical report
2. Take screenshots of each page
3. Save as PNG or JPEG
4. Upload the images

**Option 2: Use Online Conversion Tools**
1. Visit a PDF to Image converter (e.g., pdf2png.com)
2. Convert your PDF pages to PNG/JPEG
3. Download the converted images
4. Upload to the system

**Option 3: Use Image-Based Reports**
If you have medical reports in image format originally, upload those directly.

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Access the Application
1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to the application URL
3. Sign in or create an account

### Step 2: Upload Medical Reports (Images Only)
1. Click on "Upload Documents" or "Start New Session"
2. Select image files (PNG, JPEG, or WEBP)
3. Click "Upload"

### Step 3: Wait for Processing
- Files upload to Supabase Storage
- Edge function is called automatically
- OpenAI extracts text from images
- AI parses structured data
- Results saved to database

### Step 4: Review Parsed Data
- System displays extracted patient information
- View all test results with values and ranges
- Check status indicators (Normal, High, Low, Critical)
- Review lab details and dates

### Step 5: Generate Report
- Click "Generate Report"
- System creates formatted PDF report
- Download or view in browser

## 🔧 Current Limitations

### 1. PDF File Support
**Issue:** OpenAI Vision API does not support PDF files
**Impact:** Cannot process PDF medical reports directly
**Workaround:** Convert PDFs to images before uploading
**Future Fix:** Implement server-side PDF to image conversion

### 2. Multi-page PDFs
**Issue:** Single page processing only
**Impact:** Multi-page reports need separate uploads
**Workaround:** Upload each page as separate image
**Future Fix:** Batch processing with page combining

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No parsed documents found"
**Cause:** File was PDF format
**Solution:** Convert to PNG/JPEG and re-upload

### Issue: "API key not configured"
**Cause:** Edge function secret not set
**Solution:** Already fixed - API key is configured ✅

### Issue: Parsing takes too long
**Cause:** Large image file size
**Solution:** Resize images to max 2000px width before upload

### Issue: Extracted data is incorrect
**Cause:** Poor image quality or unclear text
**Solution:** Use high-resolution, clear scans
