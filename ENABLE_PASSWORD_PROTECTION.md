## Alternative: API Configuration

If you prefer to enable this via API instead of the dashboard, use:

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{project-ref}/config/auth' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {service-role-key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "SECURITY_UPDATE_PASSWORD_REQUIRE_REAUTHENTICATION": true,
    "PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH": 8,
    "PASSWORD_REQUIRED_CHARACTERS": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789",
    "SECURITY_HIBP_ENABLED": true
  }'
```

Replace:
- `{project-ref}` with your project reference
- `{service-role-key}` with your service role key
