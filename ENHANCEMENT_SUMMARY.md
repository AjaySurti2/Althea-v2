## Implementation Checklist

Follow these steps to deploy:

### Phase 1: Update System Prompt
- [ ] Open Bolt.new ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Knowledge Base
- [ ] Copy content from `ENHANCED_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
- [ ] Paste into Knowledge Base, replacing existing prompt
- [ ] Save changes

### Phase 2: Deploy Edge Function
- [ ] Verify changes in `supabase/functions/generate-health-insights/index.ts`
- [ ] Deploy using: `supabase functions deploy generate-health-insights`
- [ ] Or let Bolt.new auto-deploy when you save/commit

### Phase 3: Deploy Frontend Changes
- [ ] Verify changes in `src/components/HealthInsights.tsx`
- [ ] Run: `npm run build` (already done ‚úÖ)
- [ ] Deploy frontend to hosting service

### Phase 4: Test
- [ ] Upload a medical report
- [ ] Verify personalized greeting with patient name
- [ ] Check insights quality and clinical reasoning

## Expected User Experience Changes

### Before Enhancement:
- Generic greetings: "Let's review your results..."
- 3-5 questions for doctor
- Urgency based mainly on abnormal ranges
- Step 3: Click "Generate Report" ‚Üí Modal opens ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Close modal ‚Üí Click Download
- Less clinical context in explanations

### After Enhancement:
- Personalized: "Hello Sarah! Let's review your results from October 15, 2025..."
- 5-8 clinically relevant questions
- Urgency based on clinical guidelines (better accuracy)
- Step 3: Click "Generate & Download Report" ‚Üí PDF automatically downloads
- Rich clinical context with better analogies and explanations

## Performance Impact

**No negative performance impact:**
- Same number of API calls (actually reduced due to consolidation)
- Same token usage for AI generation
- Slightly improved response time (removed duplicate ReportManager flow)

   - Are urgency flags appropriate?

2. **User Behavior**
   - Report generation completion rate
   - Time spent on Step 3
   - Error rates during report generation

3. **Technical Metrics**
