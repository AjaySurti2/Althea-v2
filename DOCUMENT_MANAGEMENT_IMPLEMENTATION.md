# The migration file is already created
# Apply it using Supabase CLI or Dashboard
supabase db push
```

**2. Files Created:**
- ✅ `src/components/DocumentReview.tsx` (340 lines)
- ✅ `src/components/TotalReports.tsx` (420 lines)
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20251013100000_enhance_file_management.sql`

**3. Files Modified:**

## ✨ Technical Highlights

### Database Triggers
Automatic document count updates via PostgreSQL triggers:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_session_document_count
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON files
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_session_document_count();
```

### Soft Delete Pattern
Files are never hard-deleted, preserving audit trail:
```typescript
// Soft delete
await supabase
  .from('files')
  .update({ deleted_at: new Date().toISOString() })
  .eq('id', fileId);

// Query excludes soft-deleted
.is('deleted_at', null)
```

### Real-time UI Updates
Document count updates automatically when files are added/removed via database triggers.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **File Preview:** Only works for images and PDFs (by design)
2. **OCR:** Not yet implemented (requires Edge Function)
3. **AI Processing:** Not yet integrated (requires OpenAI setup)
4. **PDF Generation:** Not yet implemented (requires Edge Function)

These limitations are expected and align with the current project phase. See `TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for full AI integration roadmap.
