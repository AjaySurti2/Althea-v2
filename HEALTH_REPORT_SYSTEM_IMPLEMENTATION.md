- report_type (text: 'genetic_analysis', 'comprehensive', 'follow_up')
- report_version (integer) - Version control
- report_data (jsonb) - Structured report content
- storage_path (text) - Path to PDF/HTML in storage
- file_size (bigint) - File size in bytes

- category ('genetic', 'lifestyle', 'follow_up', 'general')
- clinical_context (text) - Why this question matters
- sort_order (integer) - Display order
- created_at (timestamptz)
```

**`report_access_log`** - HIPAA compliance audit trail
```sql

## 2. Report Structure

### Required Sections (In Order)

#### 1. Executive Summary
- **Content**: 2-3 sentence overview of overall health status

#### 2. Key Findings by Category
Organized into three subcategories:

**Genetic Factors**
- Findings related to hereditary conditions
- Family history implications
- Genetic predispositions

**Lifestyle Factors**
- Diet, exercise, sleep impacts
- Environmental exposures
- Behavioral health indicators

**Risk Factors**
- Modifiable and non-modifiable risks
- Combined risk assessments
- Preventive opportunities

**Structure per finding:**
```json
{
  "finding": "Description of what was found",
  "significance": "What this means for health",
  "action": "Specific next steps to take"
}
```

#### 3. Abnormal Values Analysis
- **Content**: All test results outside normal ranges
- **Includes**:
  - Test name
  - Current value
  - Reference range
  - Clinical explanation (plain language)
  - Severity level (high/medium/low)
- **Visual**: Color-coded by severity

#### 4. Personalized Health Recommendations
- **Count**: 3-5 actionable items
- **Priority**: Ranked by health impact
- **Structure per recommendation:**
  ```json
  {
    "recommendation": "Specific action to take",
    "rationale": "Why this is important",
    "priority": "high/medium/low",
    "timeline": "When to implement"
  }
  ```

#### 5. Family Screening Suggestions

---

## 3. AI Question Generation

### Requirements Met

**Question Count**: 3-5 per report
**Prioritization**: Based on clinical significance
- High: Critical findings requiring immediate discussion
- Medium: Important but not urgent
- Low: General health optimization

**Categories**:
- Genetic: Hereditary conditions, family history
- Lifestyle: Diet, exercise, habits
- Follow-up: Next steps, monitoring
- General: Overall health questions

### Question Structure

```typescript
{
  question: "Specific question based on test results",
  priority: "high/medium/low",
  category: "genetic/lifestyle/follow_up/general",
  clinical_context: "Why this question is important"
}
```

### Example Questions

**High Priority (Genetic)**:
"My hemoglobin A1C is 6.8%, which is at the prediabetes threshold. Given my family history of diabetes, what screening schedule do you recommend?"

**Medium Priority (Lifestyle)**:
"My LDL cholesterol is 156 mg/dL. What dietary changes would you recommend as a first step before considering medication?"

**Low Priority (General)**:
"Should I consider any supplements based on my current vitamin D levels?"

## 6. Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Features

#### Access Control
✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)** on all tables
- Users can only access their own reports
- Service role bypasses RLS for edge functions
- All queries validate `auth.uid() = user_id`

#### Data Encryption
✅ **In Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all API calls
✅ **At Rest**: PostgreSQL encryption in Supabase
✅ **Storage**: Encrypted file storage with signed URLs

#### Audit Trail
✅ **Complete logging** in `report_access_log` table:
- Report generation timestamp
- View events with timestamps
- Download events
- Delete events (if implemented)
- IP address and user agent tracking

#### Data Minimization
✅ Only necessary data stored
✅ No PII beyond medical necessities
✅ Structured data format for easy access control

### Security Best Practices

**Authentication**:
- JWT tokens required for all endpoints
- Session validation on every request
- Automatic token refresh

**Authorization**:
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- CASCADE deletes maintain referential integrity
- No cross-user data access possible

**API Security**:
- CORS headers properly configured
- Rate limiting (Supabase managed)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error messages don't leak sensitive info
